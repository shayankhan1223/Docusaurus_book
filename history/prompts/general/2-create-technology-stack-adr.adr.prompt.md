# Architecture Decision Record for Technology Stack

## Original Prompt

```text
Technology Stack Selection
```

## Response Summary

Created an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) documenting the technology stack selection for the DocuChat application. The ADR covers:

1. **Context**: Need for a documentation application with authentication, chatbot UI, and AI-powered Q&A capabilities
2. **Decision**: Selected technology stack including Docusaurus, BetterAuth, ChatKit, OpenAI Agents SDK, Cohere, and Qdrant
3. **Alternatives Considered**: Various alternatives for each technology component
4. **Consequences**: Both positive and negative outcomes of the chosen approach
5. **Rationale**: Justification for the technology choices based on project requirements

The ADR follows the standard format with a clear decision statement, context, alternatives, and consequences analysis. It provides a permanent record of why these specific technologies were chosen for the project, enabling future developers to understand the reasoning behind the architectural decisions.

## Outcome

Successfully created ADR-1 at `history/adr/001-technology-stack-selection-for-docuchat-application.md` documenting the technology stack selection for the DocuChat application. The decision record provides transparency and context for the architectural choices made in the project.
