# Table of Contents: Physical AI and Robotics

## Preface

This comprehensive textbook on Physical AI and Robotics bridges the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation. Designed for intelligent students and engineers new to the field, this book follows the philosophy of connecting theory to simulation to real-world deployment, with a focus on embodied intelligence and humanoid robot applications.
